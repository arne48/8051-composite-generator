This progam was a project of mine in which i had to show that it is possible to generatate a
stable composite signal with a 8051 @ 48Mhz.

Requirements:
* To make this run, you will need a 8051 with a 48Mhz quarz.
* Further you need at least a 4kb XCODE Module for storing the framebuffer in.
* How to setup a cheap output driver out of NAND gates is described in the USAGE-file


File-Contents:
You find the purposes of the files in the FILES-file
You find a explanation how to Setup the Hardware and change the Framebuffer in the USAGE-file
Informations about the Licence can be found in the COPYRIGHT-file
